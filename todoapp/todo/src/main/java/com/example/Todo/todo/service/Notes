isFolderOwner (keep or remove)
combine ['canEditFolder', 'canReadFolder', 'canEditTodo', 'canReadTodo'] and add file type for separation
add userId in all functions and send it from controller after getting it using JWT
copyTodo need hard refactor
refactor whole Service code

Update in shortcut + making routes
